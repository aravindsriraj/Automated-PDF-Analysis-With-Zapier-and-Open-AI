# Automated PDF Analysis With Zapier and Open AI 

**Problem Statement:**

How sales, customer support, marketing and other go-to-market functions in the company learn about what features are going to be built before they have been released so they know both the roadmap and have enough expertise on the feature to describe it to customers, prospects and partners.

**My Solution:** Automated PDF Analysis with OpenAI and Zapier ðŸ˜Ž

Zapier is an online automation tool that allows you to connect your favorite apps, such as Gmail, Slack, Mailchimp, and more than 3,000 others. You can automate repetitive tasks, known as "Zaps," by creating workflows that trigger actions in one app based on events that occur in another app.
